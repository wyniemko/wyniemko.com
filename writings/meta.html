                    <p class="article-intro">Through the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Logistics and Trade Operations Analyst at Meta (Facebook), leading the development of mass-market AR/VR products. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to demonstrate my skills in developing analytics and supply chain solutions.</p>

                    <section class="article-section">
                        <h2>Approach</h2>
                        <p>The approach I took to tackle the challenges of implementing a data-driven R&D supply chain was to first gain a deep understanding of the organization's current processes and systems. This involved conducting extensive research and analyzing large amounts of data to identify areas for improvement. I then worked closely with my team to design a comprehensive strategy that would address these challenges, leveraging best practices in analytics and supply chain management.</p>

                    <section class="article-section">
                        <h2>Data Pipeline Development</h2>
                        <p>I started my internship by leading a project aimed at optimizing the flow of information to R&D research teams. I was responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large amounts of data from various sources. This data was then used to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain and to develop recommendations for improving efficiency. I coded data pipelines using Python and made SQL queries to extract insights from the data.</p>
                        
                        <p>With this information, I was able to implement a data-driven decision-making framework that allowed us to make informed choices based on real-time data. This resulted in improved visibility and control over our operations, which in turn led to a significant reduction in waste and an increase in efficiency.</p>

                    <section class="article-section">
                        <h2>Analytics Dashboard</h2>
                        <p>Another significant accomplishment during my time at Meta was the implementation of a new data analytics tool for logistics and trade operations. I designed and developed a variety of dashboards that provided real-time insights into the company's logistics and trade operations. The tools were designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.</p>
                        
                        <p>I was responsible for coding the backend of the dashboard, including the data pipelines and SQL queries. This allowed the team to make informed decisions about production and distribution, enabling us to quickly respond to changes in demand and improve our competitiveness. Additionally, our work in supply chain management helped us to better understand our customers and suppliers, enabling us to build stronger relationships and improve our overall performance.</p>

                    <section class="article-section">
                        <h2>Leadership & Mentoring</h2>
                        <p>In addition to my technical contributions, I was also able to demonstrate my leadership skills by mentoring junior data analysts at Meta. I provided guidance and support to my team members, helping them to develop their skills and to contribute to the company's projects. This was a rewarding experience, and I was proud to be a role model for my team members.</p>

                        <h2>Impact & Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Looking back on my time at Meta, I am proud of the contributions I made to the company. My work had a significant impact on the efficiency of the company's supply chain and on the quality of the data analytics tools used by the team. I was able to demonstrate my technical skills, including data pipelines, SQL queries, and data analysis, as well as my leadership skills by mentoring aspiring data analysts.</p>
                        
                        <p>Overall, my experience at Meta was a valuable learning opportunity that allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. I am grateful for the experience and will continue to apply the skills and knowledge I gained at Meta in future endeavors.</p>
